Teacher Private Lesson

Teacher Private Lesson is a small project conducted by Manar Hasan, Baraa Aqel and Mohamad Husseini.
The idea is that a parent could create a profile on our website to link his child with a professional teacher who is willing to give private lessons for an agreed price.
When a user first visits our website, he/she will be greeted by our login page which has the registration form as well as the login form.
We also added a few pictures that are dynamically changed by hovering over them using jQurey.
After login the you'll be directed to your new profile page( if you're a parent, you'll be directed to the parents page, and if you're a teacher you'll be directed to the teacher's page)
Once you're in, if you're a parent, you can look up specific subjects or the names of the teachers (if you know any of them) and you can book an appointment for your child with that specific teacher.
If you're a teacher you can add your lessons to the lessons page so that parents will find it when they're looking for a certain subject.
Our project was built on the Django framework and we implemented JS as well as jQuery and Ajax in specific pages.
